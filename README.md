We are interested in structural design, electronic structure and physical property regulation of two-dimensional semiconductors and magnetic related materials; Theoretical calculation of electronic state behavior at the interface of low dimensional van der Waals heterojunction; Photocatalysis characteristics of new energy materials and functional devices.

We are learning Condensed matter physics，First principle calculation， Machine learning.
